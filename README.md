# selected-family-members

To implement this task, I used php without using the framework,
I also used pdo to communicate with the database, and finally I displayed the result in a ‍‍‍```.php``` file.

In addition, I used Composer to manage the project and use ```.env``` more easily

# Installation and Run

for installation and run this project :

1 : clone it on your local machine

2 : run the ```composer install``` .

3 : copy ```.env.example``` on your ```.env``` file and modify your ```.env``` file for database connection.

4: create a database and import ```family_members.sql``` and insert your data.

5: run ```php -S localhost:8000``` on project root.

6: open ```localhost:8000``` on your browser.

<b>Note:</b> You can sort all columns by click on heading


Thats it
